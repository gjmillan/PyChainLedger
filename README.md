# PyChain Ledger

![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

# Online Application
At the launch of Strealit, the application will open up a browser that contains the form to submit a cryptocurrency transaction. As seen in the image below, you will see three fields to input information for a block to be created: Sender, Receiver, Amount.

The below image contains an example of three executed blocks with the information of the three fields.

On the right hand side of the screen you can find the "Block Inspector", where the information of the executed block can be found.

# Validation Chain
An important aspect of the tool is to ensure if the blockchain can be validated. By selecting the "Validate Chain" button on the screen, we can confirm if the transaction is validated as expected. This is communicated with a "True" or "False" message. In the image below you can see an example of the validated chain.
